#### Spotify For Artists
We built lots of amazing tools for artists on the Spotify platform and packaged them into a mobile application.
I was a lead developer on the team and did a combination of Android and back end work for the app. 

#### Concert Recommendations

We partnered with Songkick to get data about concerts happening in a users area. We then recommended concerts to
users based on their listening history. I built a feature that displayed a list of recommendations and allowed 
users to learn more about the concert details and it's performers.

#### Artist Profile

I built several sections that make up an artist profile on Spotify: Biography, Gallery, Upcoming Concerts, 
Discography and more.

#### Now Playing View

I built a variation of the Now Playing view where the static image cover art was replaced by a looping 8 second 
video. Artists could upload a video using the Artist app, and listeners would see a full screen moving video that
would loop while music played.
