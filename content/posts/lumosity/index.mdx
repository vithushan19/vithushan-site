#### Japanese Launch

I helped translate the strings in the app to Japanese and made small UI fixes in cases where the translation was 
much longer than the original English text.

#### Internal Build Finder

We had a Quality Assurance team of testers who would test out various changes before merging them into master. 
I created a Jenkins job that would go through all the branches, create builds for each of them and upload them to 
Amazon S3. In the Lumosity application there was an employee-only debug menu, where I added a search feature.
The testers could search by branch name and then download the latest build for that branch to their phone. This
allowed testers to test out different features as developers worked on them.

#### Automated Test Suite

I built a suite of automated tests for the Lumosity application. I researched and evaluated different testing
frameworks like Selenium, Robolectric and Espresso. Espresso was still in it's early days and most apps were
using Robolectric. After playing around with the different frameworks I decided to build the full suite with
Espresso as it was the easiest for me to learn. I wrote a bunch of different smoke tests for different features,
which allowed the QA team to focus on new changes rather than making sure that existing functionality wasn't 
broken. The QA team really liked me by the time I left.
