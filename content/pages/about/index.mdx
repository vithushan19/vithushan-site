Hi!

My name is Vithushan Namasivayasivam. I'm a software engineer who specializes in Android development. I'm a graduate
of the University of Waterloo. Because of their amazing coop program I got co-op placements at companies like Zynga
and SAP. Those co-op opportunities put me on a great track for amazing jobs in the future. My first job out of school
was for a software consulting firm called Infusion. As a consultant you get to work on lots of different codebases and
you start to develop patterns for solving similar problems.

After Infusion, I spent 4 years in New York City working for Spotify and Instagram. At Spotify I worked on various
product teams and at Instagram I was on the Performance team. 

After my time in New York, I moved back to my hometown Toronto to join an early stage startup. Key Living was a real
estate startup that wanted to deliver an innovative form of home ownership.

Presently, I work at Duolingo building out new types of lessons for our users.
